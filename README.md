Parse _.fit_ files from your activity tracker with _fitfile4j-parser_ or convert them to JSON with _fitfile4j-cli_.

Started as a spin-off from my previous experience on reading _.fit_ files wth Rust (https://github.com/meistermeier/rusty-but-fit),
now available as a Java library.

At the moment the cli part creates exactly the output of rusty-but-fit's `fit-to-json` tool.
